# C_Language_Parser

This was completed in my C software development class. It displays an intermediate between C and C++ where classes exists as structs containing function pointers to their methods. C_Language_Parser should display my ability to understand how object oriented programming really works and a deep understanding of computer theory concepts like push down automatons and context free languages.
